            Add functionality to open source mobile wallet and build terminal
            with R-PI and RC532 breakout board
            \vspace{5pt}
        }{%
          % Situation
            For my entry in the second boltathon (lightning hackathon) I wanted
            to address a UX issue with using mobile wallets.\\
          % Target
            The existing payment methods in the market from Google and Apple
            all utilise Near Field Communication (NFC) to provide contactless
            payment.  This was not available for bitcoin lightning wallets.\\
          % Action
            The solution involved creating a payment requestor terminal from a
            a Raspberry PI with a RC532 breakout board and a mobile device
            running a bitcoin lightning wallet which I would add NFC
            functionality to.\\
          % Result
            I was able to produce a prototype terminal and extend the open
            source zap-android wallet, the enahnacement was refined and merged
            into the main project.\\

    \subsection{Migration of documentation to multi platform publishing}
        \ifthenelse{\boolean{pdf}}{%
	        Improved quality, reduced duplication and decoupled content from
            presentation
            \vspace{5pt}
        }{%
          % Situation
            The aquisition of the company required rebranding our customer
            facing documentation.  Reworking the word documents was going to be
            a costly exercise taking 2 weeks.\\
          % Target
            We wanted to introduce a document lifecycle process and improve
            the management of content so that it could adapt to future
            requirements with minimal overhead.\\
          % Action
            To tackle the management of content, we made the decision to
            migrate the contect to a markup language.  This allowed the content
            to be decoupled from the presentation.  To introduce document
            lifecycle management, we adopted the existing development workflow
            utilising github and JIRA.\\
          % Result
            The consistency and accuracy of documentation has benefited.  With
            changes to branding being able to be applied across the content in
            4 hours rather than 2 weeks.  In addition to PDF documentation we
            have also been able to publish the same content to HTML.}

	        Reduction in code reuse and defects for scripting projects
            \vspace{5pt}
        }{%
          % Situation
            Many solutions required the same or similar features that would be 
            scripted for each project. This resulted in duplicate of effort and 
            a high number of defects.
          % Target
            By creating a component library we could reduce the production time 
            and increase the quality of solutions provided.
          % Action
            I produced a business case for the creation of a set of standard
            components that was well received and gained approval for a proof 
            of concept.  This became the first component of many that was 
            produced and was able to be managed through a formal SDLC.
          % Result
            The average amount for time required to produce scripts was reduced 
            by 40\%.  Defects were reduced and resolutions made easier as they 
            were typically configuration related rather than bugs in the script.}

	\subsection{Establishing Technical Account Manager role}
        \ifthenelse{\boolean{pdf}}{%
            Developing processes and improving relationships with key customers
            \vspace{5pt}
        }{%
          % Situation
            As a part of the customer success strategy, the business wanted to 
            provide technical leadership and govenance to key customers.
          % Target
            A new Technical Account Manager role needed to be established and 
            rolled out to key customers.  This would provide technical 
            leadership of issue resolution and project delivery.
          % Action
            In a team of 6 technical consultants, across 3 continents we defined
            the scope of the role, documented the intitial processes and a
            continuous inprovement framework.
          % Result
            Over the first 6 months we were able to onboard 7 key accounts in
            EMEA, reduce the issue backlog of these accounts from 64 to 38 and 
            successfully mediate several project delivery conflicts.}
