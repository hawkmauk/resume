            Add functionality to open source mobile wallet and configure a

            For my entry in the second boltathon (lightning hackathon) I wanted
            to address a UX issue with using mobile wallets.\\
            The existing payment methods in the market from Google and Apple
            all utilise Near Field Communication (NFC) to provide contactless
            payment.  This was not available for bitcoin lightning wallets.\\
            The solution involved creating a payment requestor terminal from a
            a Raspberry PI with a RC532 breakout board and a mobile device
            running a bitcoin lightning wallet which I would add NFC
            functionality to.\\
            I was able to produce a prototype terminal and extend the open
            source zap-android wallet, the enahnacement was refined and merged
            into the main project.\\
