\section{Overview}
This repository provides a build system for resumes that are tailored to 
different roles using the same source.\\
It uses \latex as a markup language to decouple the content from the
presentation and allow publishing different content depending on the output
medium.  For example, the HTML output contains extended text that would take up
too much space on a PDF page.
