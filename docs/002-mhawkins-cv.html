<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Adobe announced in 2018 that Flash would no longer work after Jan 2021. Several
software components used Flash that would need to upgraded.<br 
class="newline" />We had around 300 customers to upgrade in an 18 month period with no scope for
moving the deadline. Each upgrade project was to average a 6 week life-cycle and
included one or more test systems.<br 
class="newline" />Working a member of the programme committee I managed the resource capacity
planning and provided feedback on opportunities to improve processes.<br 
class="newline" />The programme was completed with only 8 customers not upgraded by the time
that Flash was retired. The weekly update meetings with the team were
effective at building trust, collaboration, sharing information and strengthening
performance.

leadership and governance to key customers.<br 
class="newline" />A new Technical Account Manager role needed to be established and rolled out to
key customers. This would provide technical leadership of issue resolution and project
delivery.<br 
class="newline" />In a team of 6 technical consultants, across 3 continents we defined the scope of
the role, documented the initial processes and a continuous improvement
framework.<br 
class="newline" />Over the first 6 months we were able to onboard 7 key accounts in EMEA, reduce the
issue backlog of these accounts from 64 to 38 and successfully mediate several project
delivery conflicts.

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Pitney Bowes Software consisted of several mature products that were managed with
a traditional waterfall methodology. As a part of a strategic change program, the
development life-cycle and professional services delivery frameworks were to adopt an
agile approach. As the professional services representative in the program, I
researched and attended training sessions with Mike Cohn of Mountain Goat
Software to provide an implementation plan to the management team and deliver
training to the other team members. Over 3 months we were able to start delivering
agile project management and iterative delivery of solutions which decreased the
defects through the increased test cycles.
